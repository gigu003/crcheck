Description: The iarccheck package is designed to perform internal and
        consistent checks for cancer registration individual cases based on
        the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) standards. It
        provides a suite of functions to check the validation and consistency
        of data items such as sex, age, site, morphology, behavior, and grade,
        as well as combinations of these data items. By systematically auditing
        these data elements, iarccheck helps maintain high-quality cancer
        registry data, supporting reliable cancer research and reporting.
